This is my website called "Dollar Store Spoon University" . To be honest, I couldn't come up with a name so I just took the name of another cooking website "Spoon University" and added "Dollar Store" infront of it because clearly my version is much simpler. 

I made 4 pages: a main page, login page, cookbook page, and a recipe page. On the recipe page you can type in the name of the recipe in the search bar. 

I only added one recipe to the recipe page which is "Instant Ramen", you can click that and it will take you to a recipe for ramen from a different website. 

On the Cookbook page, you can "purchase" a cookbook and it will show the number of cookbooks purchased.

I didn't insert many images, but I just tried to insert them where it felt appropriate.
